Some of the programming patterns we used were the singleton pattern and state patterns. The card.lua file has the card’s instances which makes sure that we didn’t have duplicates and had consistent card data. We also used state patterns to keep track of mana and when player pressed the submit button and when it came to the game's state such as the menu/title, credits and acutal game play scenes. We think we did a good job when organizing the code into separate files to keep track of everything and make sure the card data was consistent. The main file is where all the code is. We started my creating local vairables that would contain the game's states, music, backgrounds, and images. In our draw function we have all our scenes and gameplay mechanics. We also have a function that deals with all of the possibel keys that can be pressed which allow the player to move through the different scenes which are the play, menu, and credits. We have the music playing in the menu/titlw scene that plays on loop. Both the menu/title screen have drawn out background images that were imported. Assets:
